This project is for learning and developing API for FGC assignment.

A quick rundown of what this API does. This python code, when run, will ask the user to input the user's Zip Code or City Name.
Inputing a Zip Code or City Name will then fetch that info from an API (in this project it is for the weather.) and display it to the user.

Inside the project the user can modify the "if weather_info:" block to uncomment or comment out info they want to see displayed.

The API I am using is https://www.weatherapi.com/
